<b>MSC - Main Spec Changes (v0.1.3)</b>
Compatible with World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a)

MSC is a specialized tool for Raid Leaders and Loot Masters to track and broadcast changes to players' Main Specs. Whether a Paladin is switching from Holy to Prot for a specific boss or a Rogue is changing their PVP spec to a PVE spec, MSC ensures the raid is informed and loot eligibility is clear.


🚀 <b>Key Features</b>
Intelligent Spec Selection: Class-specific dropdowns (e.g., Mages only see DPS/PVP, while Druids see Feral/Boomie/Resto/etc.).

Automatic Data Management: * Persistence: Data survives UI reloads and disconnects while in a group.

Auto-Cleanup: Automatically removes data for players who leave the raid and clears the database entirely when the group disbands.

Smart Reporting: Broadcasts changes to RAID_WARNING (/rw) in multi-line chunks to prevent chat throttling or character limits.

Version Verification: Built-in "Version Check" to ensure all assistants/loot masters are running the same version of the addon.

Advanced Minimap Icon: * Left-Click: Toggle Main Window.

Right-Click: Close Main Window.

Middle-Click: Open the Options Menu.

Integrated Options Menu: Easily toggle the minimap icon and test the reporting system,
